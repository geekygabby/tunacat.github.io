        <p>All the things to know about cookies!</p>
        <p>No, these are not the kind of cookies you bake and eat. These cookies are hidden but a very important part of browsing. Cookies are bits of data that are sent to and from your browser in order to identify you. This data primarily appears as a string of numbers and letters within a text file. These temporary folders are stored on your device and from there companies/advertisers are able to recommend products, articles, or videos to you. There are two types of cookies: Authentication cookies and Tracking cookies.</p>
