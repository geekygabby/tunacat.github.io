        <h1>What are cookies?</h1>
        <p> <strong>All the things to know about cookies!</strong> </p>
        <p>You may know what HTTP means (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or how to delete your browser history, but do you know what cookies are? You may see them every time you go to a new website, but have no idea what they are. And, no, these are not the kind of cookies you bake and eat. These cookies are hidden but a very important part of browsing. Cookies are bits of data that are sent to and from your browser in order to identify you. This data primarily appears as a string of numbers and letters within a text file. These temporary folders are stored on your device and from there companies/advertisers are able to recommend products, articles, or videos to you. There are two primary types of cookies: First-party cookies and Third-party cookies.</p>
        <p>1. First-party cookies: They are set by the website you're currently visiting. They help improve the user experience, like remembering your language preference or items in a shopping cart.</p>
        <p>2. Third-party cookies: These are set by domains other than the one you're visiting often by advertisers or analytics services. They are typically used for tracking user behavior across different websites and building detailed profiles for targeted ads.</p>
        <h2>Real-World Example of Cookies Use:</h2>
        <p> âž« When you add items to a shopping cart on Amazon and come back later to see they are still there! That is exmaple of cookies at work! </p>
        <h2> Risks of Cookies: </h2>
        <p>Privacy concerns: Cookies, especially third-party ones, can track your activity across multiple websites, leading to potential privacy violations. </p>
        <p>Security risks: Cookies may store sensitive information (like login credentials or personal details), which could be accessed by malicious actors if not properly protected. </p>
        <p>Tracking and profiling: Advertisers can use cookies to gather vast amounts of personal data, creating detailed profiles of your interests and habits for targeted ads, sometimes without your knowledge or consent. </p>
        <p>User tracking: Many websites use cookies to track your browser history which can be used for targeted advertising. This has raised significant privacy concerns, especially in regards to third-party cookies.</p>
        <p>GDPR and CCPA Regulations: Laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act in California have had major impacts on how cookies are used and how websites must first ask for the user's consent before using them.</p>
        <p>Cookies consent banners are now common on most websites to comply with regulations. The user usually is presented with a pop-up asking them to accept or reject cookies and some offer the ability to customize the cookie preferences.</p>
