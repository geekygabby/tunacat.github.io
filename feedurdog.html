        <h1>What are cookies?</h1>
        <p>All the things to know about cookies!</p>
        <p>No, these are not the kind of cookies you bake and eat. These cookies are hidden but a very important part of browsing. Cookies are bits of data that are sent to and from your browser in order to identify you. This data primarily appears as a string of numbers and letters within a text file. These temporary folders are stored on your device and from there companies/advertisers are able to recommend products, articles, or videos to you. There are two primary types of cookies: First-party cookies and Third-party cookies.</p>
        <p>1. First-party cookies: There are set by the website you're currently visiting. They help improve the user experience, like remembering your language preference or items in a shopping cart.</p>
        <p>2. Third-party cookies: These are set by domains other than the one you're visiting often by advertisers or analytics services. They are typically used for tracking user behavior across different websites and building detailed profiles for targeted ads.</p>
        <p>Risks of Cookies:</p>
        <p>Privacy concerns: Cookies, especially third-party ones, can track your activity across multiple websites, leading to potential privacy violations. </p>
        <p>Security risks: Cookies may store sensitive information (like login credentials or personal detials), which could be accessed by malicious actors if not properly protected. </p>
        <p>Tracking and profiling: Advertisers can use cookies to gather vast amounts of personal data, creating detailed profiles of your interests and habits for targeted ads, sometimes without your knowledge or consent. </p>
