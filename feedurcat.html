        <h1>Protect yourself from cookies!</h1>
        <p>Your computer's browser is probably full of cookies, and companies use that information to advertise to you. This is just one aspect of protecting your privacy. Companies still use non-cookie alternatives to track you across websites and even clearing your cookies cannot stop that. By changing your settings you can protect yourself while browsing. There are first-party cookies and third-party cookies.</p>
        <p>First-party cookies are what we have been talking about this whole time, what the site initially uses to track you.</p>
        <p> 1. Clear cookies regularly: You can delete cookies regularly browser settings periodically to reduce the amount of personal data stored on your device.</p>
        <p> 2. Use incognit or private browsing mode: Browsers have modes that prevent cookies from being stored after you close the browsing window. This can help to prevent long-term tracking.</p>
        <p> 3. Block third-party cookies: Mosst modern browsers offer settings to block third-party cookies. You can activate this feature in your browser's privacy settings. </p>
        <p> 4. Use cookie management tools: Some browser extensions and apps allow you to manage cookies in a moe detailed way, blocking certain cookies or only accepting them from trusted sites. </p>
        <p> 5. Enable "Do Not Track" (DNT) setting: While not always respected by websites, this setting lets websites know that you do not want to be tracked. You can enable it in your browser's privacy settings. </p>
        <p> 6. Use privacy-focused browsers: Some browsers such as Brave or Firefox are designed to block cookies and trackers by default. Additionally, they offer better privacy than more mainstream browsers. </p>
        <p> 7. Review privacy policies: When visiting websites, check their cookie policy to understand what data they are collecting and how they are using it. You can usually customize cookie preferences when prompted. </p>
        <p> 8. Use a VPN: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can help mask your IP address and encrypt your internet traffic, making it harder for cookies to track your activity and location. </p>
        <h2> How You Can Protect Yourself in This Changing Online Environment: </h2>
        <p> → Use Privacy-Focused Browsers: Switch to browsers like <strong>Brave</strong> or <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong> as they will block third-party cookies and trackers by default. I personally use DuckDuckGo on my mobile devices. </p>
        <p> → Adopt Privacy Tools: Consider using a browser extension like <strong>uBlock origin</strong> (which I also use) to block tracking scripts and cookies. </p>
        <p> → Be Mindful of Permissions: Always read cookie consent banners and customize your prefernces to limit cross website tracking. </p>
        <p> → Stay Informed: Make sure to keep up with privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA which will continue to evolve in response to the new developments around cookies and data mining. </p>
