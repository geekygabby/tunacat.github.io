        <p>Your computer's browser is probably full of cookies, and companies use that information to advertise to you. This is just one aspect of protecting your privacy. Companies still use non-cookie alternatives to track you across websites and even clearing your cookies cannot stop that. By changing your settings you can protect yourself while browsing. There are first-party cookies and third-party cookies.</p>
        <p>First-party cookies are what we have been talking about this whole time, what the site initially uses to track you.</p>
